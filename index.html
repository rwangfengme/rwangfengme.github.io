            <h1 class="ps_intro">Welcome! Here's my statement of purpose that will tell you why I'm pursuing a master degree in HCI&CS field.</h1>
            <article class="ps_art">
              <p>As a child growing up in a small city, the amounts of information one can get were limited. Things changed when I was first exposed to the Internet as it provided a new, boundless world that offered infinite possibilities and exciting opportunities. Furthermore, it helped me shape the environment around me and drove me to make up the decision to pursue a career related to it.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>The first decision I made was entering CUC (Communication University of China), majoring in Digital Media Arts. From creativity thinking to design, programming to publishing, the undergraduate program stretches the students mind and demands students to be able to adapt to its exponential learning curve. One important task  was to develop Internet/mobile applications from scratch. This tasks demands students to learn and comprehend various knowledge, painting, design and programming. I devote most of my free time in doing this thing. Because it brings me great satisfaction when I built up the applications step by step.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>In addition to just studying, I also found a lot of chances to utilize the knowledge I learned from class. As the secretary of the students union web department, I was in charge of the development and daily running of the students union’s website. I also led my union members to build up a live streaming system to broadcast important activities held in the school. This system was popular with students for it allowed many who could not attend the activities to view the events online. With the professor’s help, I also did some research about the emerging technology like NFC. I first saw Google showing their NFC application on I/O 2011, this convenient data transfer method attracted me to source for more information on the workings of it. Although there was very limited information about NFC online in Chinese, it did not deter me. I translated online information and took a look on Google’s Android SDK code, finally understood the mechanisms of the code. My graduation design project was an Android app that used NFC to transfer contacts information, which got very high evaluation among the teachers.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>When I graduated, I got a job from Sina Weibo (Chinese micro blog service, likes Twitter), becoming a Web Front-end engineer. My job scope was to write JavaScript code to fulfill the interactions on the webpage. This job not only focus on programming, but also the design and interactions. Just as what I learnt in CUC. Furthermore the thought of my product will be used by millions of people made me excited and motivated me to improve my abilities during my free time. From 2012, I have completed hundreds of development tasks and participated in several important company programs. Like a Webpage performance monitoring system that generate performance charts and send warning emails to the admin when the webpage becoming unusually slow for the users. Or a multi-version distribution system is to help engineer to quickly change the online code and do the A/B Test.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>I learnt a lot from the practical work but the interaction with the experienced colleagues also let me know there are still more things I have to learn. So I decided to go back to the school, take a graduate program to enhance my abilities. I’ll still focus on web/mobile programming and HCI and try to do more useful Web/Mobile apps. </p>
              <br/>
              <p>So, I do hope to get the admission of a HCI or a CS program.</p>
